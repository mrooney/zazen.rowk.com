# About
A simple zazen timer. Create URLs for different timing settings, and
bookmark them for later use.

# Examples
* [http://zazen.rowk.com/b10g](http://zazen.rowk.com/b10g)
 * ring a bell, wait 10 minutes, and hit a gong.
* [http://zazen.rowk.com/bg30g10b30ggg](http://zazen.rowk.com/bg30g10b30ggg)
 * generally imitates a period of zazen at a temple: two 30 minute periods of sitting with 10 minutes of kinhin in between.

A 'b' or 'g' plays a bell or gong sound, respectively. A number
represents a number of minutes to wait.

Adjust the URL in your browser's address bar until you arrive at your desired
setting, hit enter to start it, then bookmark it for use later.

Make sure your speakers are on and are loud enough to hear :)
